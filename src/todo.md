TODO: 
- [ ] Add a new dataset layer as base.
- [ ] Add construct parameters
- [ ] In core-default, re-export dataFactory, datasetFactory?
- [ ] Add a rdfs-seeAlso mixin
- [ ] Loader VS fetcher ?
- [ ] Type check the constructor params of datasets (Dataset.getObject, MixinFactory)
- [ ] Ensure the person is builded from a profileDocument.
- [ ] Add a lastLoaded atribute in dataset ?
- [ ] Add a SPARQL mixin

- [x]Â Move the DatasetMixin into the mixins directory
- [x] Return undefined in getObject

- [x] Reorganize source with two folders: packages and mixins
- [x] Use a DatasetExt ?
- [x] Move the DatasetImpl class to the core package
- [x] Add Semantizer:load and Semantizer:build methods
- [x] In mixins, use the loader from semantizer and accept an overload
- [x] Add a core package and use the core-default as a pre-configured installation
- [x] Add a Semantizer at the Dataset level, to get access to the loader?
- [x] Add a Semantizer class to host the config (loader, DatasetImpl, etc)
- [x] Add a load() method to load the object itself
