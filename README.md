Semantizer is a library to help building objects that can be represented as RDF datasets. It is built on top of RDFJS and use mixins.

This library was writen for the [Data Food Consortium](https://datafoodconsortium.org) project (DFC) which aims to provide interoperability between food supply chain platforms. We use the semantizer library inside our connector library to help developers to exchange data expressed with the DFC ontology.
